-F5 instead of Ctrl-E?

-Maybe a more sophisticated version of find/replace, where I break up the String? It is pretty slow on an 8MB file.
  -Loop thru 20000 characters at a time, appending last searchFor.length() from previous to first. 
  -This becomes even trickier with regex, but Matcher does have the ability to tell you that the end of a string is a partial match.
  
-How about dual-window mode. Only two windows, that's it.


-Long term problems
    
  -Weird background bugs
    -OK I tried this new thing with =Xshare:off, hoping it prevents processes from messing with each other
    -Do you see that doo doo where java says it's starting up with mixed mode "sharing"? 
    -Mostly when it runs two at once.
    -Changing menu item titles on show seemed to screw up the menu, but that was before lunch. It broke both the production AND test menus, in fact, which is crazy. 
    -Noticed that the menu was acting up, chewing up text. Maybe it was because the menu was going off screen with long file names. Maybe I should put ellipsis on the long file names. Worth considering. Also, 15 is too many to sift thru.
    -Might have been the background goofup in Kalert. Using setOpaque(false) was better.
    -Watch out for system.out.println's. That may be freaking out the exe.
    -Exe?
      -Consider jexepack, which costs $100 or you get an alert everytime you open it.
    -Currently running off of a .bat. That seems to work. I made a shortcut with a .ico and that seems to work when I copy it. but it needs a readme to indicate that the shortcut will only work if you first double-click it with klonk.bat in the same directory, so it can update itself. No wait, shortcut icon dies after reboot.
  
  -Slow scrolling:
    -Too many key listeners?
    -Noticed that it seems to slow down with a lot of windows open. Hmph. Don't tell me I have to resort to... oh gawd no. Not recreating jtextareas when I switch windows. Horrors.



-Maybe  
  -About should show an icon
  -Undo
    -Undo to last save?
    -You could have undostep include whether selection is forwards or backwards. Just a boolean.
  -I need that resizer in the lower right.
  -Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook()
  -Selected text color, selected background color
  -Indents & Tabs, Fonts should only enable ok button when something changes.
    -Also should show message when ok is clicked.
