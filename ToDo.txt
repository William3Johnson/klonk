-OSX
  -The popup file switcher needs a next unsaved file dammit
  -We ought to make it where you can pick between fixed-width and not fixed-width fonts in the picker.
  -I need alt-g to replace F3 or at least enhance it.
  -Consider using the default java runtime and shrinking the deploy (leave after the = blank): -Bruntime=
  -Insert spaces to align doesn't show the right shortcut.
  -Shift-home & Shift-end don't work. They just move the cursor, they don't select.
    -Also ctrl-home and ctrl-end don't work.
  -Command-line invocation sucks. Maybe I should do an "Open files" feature where I can just chunk things to the clipboard Ctrl-Alt-O?. Or else startup a listener on a port. Ugh.
    -Automatically paste the clipboard in if it has something.
  -KeyMapping
    -We really need a sorted properties file
  -To display an indicator that a window was modified, you need to use the Swing property Window.documentModified. It can be set on any subclass of JComponent that implements a top-level window using the putClientProperty() method. The value of the property is either Boolean.TRUE or Boolean.FALSE
  -Right click menu is still on ctrl-everything, shouldn't it go option-everything... and preserve ctrl-everything...
    -Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste
    -Also the top menu for undo/redo

-Current
  -Switch ms windows exe build to use the new thing I found

  -Ctrl - and Ctrl + should resize font

  -SSH Sudo

  -Help should should show the name of your current log file.

  -Alt-f-d doesn't work with ssh and needs to be disabled.

  -Hey and a menu item for File-Delete? With confirm of course. Hmph.

  -Load file & Find/replace are abusive. Fix them.
    -Load file ought to be able to find out about LF/CR/CRLF after the fact. Or just read a few lines. I don't know.


  -Tabs & Indents allows invalid input - letters instead of numbers

  -When I switch windows the cursor position frequently goes somewhere else

  -Ctrl-W ought to just close the editor if no files are open. It makes no difference.


-Maybe
  -SSH Todo:
    Single quotes in the filename are a bit of a problem, and double quotes, and whatever else.
    When we disconnect the network the ssh session doesn't know. We could do Session.sendKeepAliveMsg or Session.sendIgnore
    What about when a host key changes or is missing? Will we blow up?

  -File open ought to start off the session with the last directory opened.
   It's annoying when it defaults to my stupid home directory. Well ...ssh. Ugh.

  -Favorite commands.


  -Maybe a more sophisticated version of find/replace, where I break up the String? It is pretty slow on an 8MB file.
    -Loop thru 20000 characters at a time, appending last searchFor.length() from previous to first.
    -Note that java.util.regex.Matcher does have the ability to tell you that the end of a string is a partial match.
  -How about dual-window mode. Only two windows, that's it.
  -About should show an icon
  -Undo
    -Undo to last save?
    -You could have undostep include whether selection is forwards or backwards. Just a boolean.
  -Selected text color, selected background color
  -Indents & Tabs, Fonts should only enable ok button when something changes.
    -Also should show message when ok is clicked.

-Long term problems
  -Weird background bugs
    -Do you see that doo doo where java says it's starting up with mixed mode "sharing"?
    -Mostly when it runs two at once.
    -Exe alternatives?
      -Consider jexepack, which costs $100 or you get an alert everytime you open it.

  -Slow scrolling:
    -Too many key listeners?
    -Noticed that it seems to slow down with a lot of windows open. Hmph. Don't tell me I have to resort to... oh gawd no. Not recreating jtextareas when I switch windows. Horrors.



-Fixed?
  -New Klonk Bug - I have a fix in place per the ideas offered on stacko:
